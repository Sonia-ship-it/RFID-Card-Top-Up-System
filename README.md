# 🛰️ RFID Nexora_001 Dashboard


## 🦾 Overview

The **RFID Dashboard** is a high-end card management system designed for instant synchronization. Utilizing a glassmorphism dark-mode interface, it provides users with immediate visibility into their card status and financial balance via persistent WebSocket connections.

### ⚡ Key Features

* **📡 Live Sync**: Instant balance updates via WebSockets.
* **💸 Seamless Top-ups**: Rapid fund injection with built-in loading states.
* **☁️ IoT Ready**: Fully integrated with the `broker.benax.rw` MQTT broker.
* **💎 Glassmorphism UI**: A sleek, responsive design crafted with Tailwind CSS.

## 🧠 System Logic

The system operates on a four-stage communication loop:

1. **Detection**: Arduino scans a card and publishes the UID to `rfid/team_07/card/status`.
2. **Broker**: The MQTT broker relays the message to the Node.js server.
3. **WebSocket**: The server pushes the new balance/UID to all connected browser clients.
4. **Interaction**: Users perform top-ups via the UI, which triggers a POST request to update the state.

## 🛠️ API & Events

### 🌐 REST API

**`POST /topup`** Used to add funds to a specific card.

* **Payload:**
```json
{ "uid": "A1B2C3D4", "amount": 100 }

```


* **Success Response:**
```json
{ "success": true, "uid": "A1B2C3D4", "balance": 150 }

```



### 🤝 WebSocket Message

Clients receive a JSON object whenever a card is scanned or updated:

```json
{
  "uid": "A1B2C3D4",
  "balance": 150
}

```
